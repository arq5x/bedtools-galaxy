**What it does**

This tool converts a BAM file to a BED file. The end coordinate is computed
by inspecting the CIGAR string. The QNAME for the alignment is used as the 
BED name field and, by default, the MAPQ is used as the BED score. 

.. class:: infomark

The "Report spliced BAM alignment..." option breaks BAM alignments with the "N" (splice) operator into distinct BED entries.  For example, using this option on a CIGAR such as 50M1000N50M would, by default, produce a single BED record that spans 1100bp.  However, using this option, it would create two separate BED records that are each 50bp in size and are separated by 1000bp (the size of the N operation).  This is important for RNA-seq and structural variation experiments.


.. class:: warningmark

If using a custom BAM alignment TAG as  the BED score, note that this must be a numeric tag (e.g., type "i" as in NM:i:0).

.. class:: warningmark

If creating a BEDPE output (see output formatting options), the BAM file should be sorted by query name.
