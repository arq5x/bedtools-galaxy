**What it does**

This tool converts counts the number of intervals in a BAM or BED file (the source) that overlap another BED file (the target).

.. class:: infomark

The output file will be comprised of each interval from your original target BED file, plus an additional column indicating the number of intervals in your source file that overlapped that target interval.

.. class:: warningmark

This tool requires that `bedtools`__ has been installed on your system.
